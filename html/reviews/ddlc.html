    <p>DDLC is the most haunting thing I have ever experienced. I had this game recommended by a friend who said that if I am not hooked by the end of act 1, I can stop playing. Let’s say that I knew when act 1 was over, and I knew I was hooked. <br><br>

    DDLC reels you in with its anime-esk dating simulator that is completely harmless. Except for Mo-ÿÀËůļĦŘĖŵŨŎ®. She is subtly creepy in the first act, but it really starts to ramp up throughout the later game when you realize what she has been planning all along. Her haunting fourth wall breaks, and knowledge about who you are starts to add up, and it's fucking SCARY. Dan Salvato used the visual novel medium fantastically here. This was my first one, and I’m definitely engaged. I got a little bored within the first act, but it wasn’t anything unbearable. <br><br>

    The music and GUI are beautifully done, and I never felt that the story was dragging on at all throughout my short 5 hours with it. This game is a must-try if you aren’t disturbed easily and aren’t depressed. It fucked me up, and it will fuck you up too. This game was fresh, toxic, and really fun to play through over the last few days. <br><br>
