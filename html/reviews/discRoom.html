    <h1>Disc Room</h1>
    <h6>A breath of fresh air in the monotony of the backlog</h6>
    <p>Disk Room randomly showed up on my reccomended on the xbox home page one day, and I said, well, fuck it, let’s see what happens. <br><br>
    
    It took less than a minute to download, and boom I was in. I was in love with the art style as soon as I saw it, and got addicted to the gameplay loop. It’s art style was cool, and I was actually impressed on how good this shitty pixel art turned out. <br><br>

    I beat it in under 2 hours, and had my fun. I wasn’t too interested in the story, but found the comic strip explanation entising. I didn’t care too much for easter eggs, and the music felt cool at first, but got very stale very quick. The game was punishing and difficult, yet it never felt unfair which is what really had me addicted. <br><br>

    Overall, it was a cool little side quest, but defintely won’t be revisiting it in the future. It was just mediocre. And mediocre is fine, it’s just, well, I want to play great games. <br><br>
