    <h1>TMNT: Shredder's Revemge</h1>
    <h6>A fantastic party side-scrolling beat em’ up</h6>
    <p>On a boring evening in the Redmond household, young Christopher asked if we could play some xbox, after getting frustrated with DK Tropical Freeze. I was also pretty frustrated, so I said what the hell, let’s do it. <br><br>

    I googled the best couch co-op games on xbox game pass (to save money) and found that most people reccomended TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge. Chris was hooked at the trailer, so I downloaded it, and we hopped in. <br><br>
    
    We had a blast. We beat the game in 2 days and it only took us about 3 hours in-game time. This game is a slept on revival of the famous streets of rage age beat em’ ups from previous decades. It stays faithful with it’s gameplay and feel, yet doesn’t overcomplicate characters, movesets, collectibles, and bosses. <br><br>

    The game was very well balanced. No character felt too OP, and most of the enemies were impossible to ignore, but easy enough to take out in a few hits. One of my favorite parts of the combat is the enemies fading to black when they die. In the middle of a long-stringed combo, I can back off and know that I won’t have to deal with him again. The bosses felt hard, and I only have complaints about a few who were designed so poorly we almost quit.
    Story mode is a fantastic touch. This adds soooo many great mechanics like revive, restart levels, collectibles, and adds a new flavor of replayability. At Christophers current skill level, we wouldn’t have lasted a while in arcade mode, with perma-death. The ability to level up characters is great too, as we felt a semi-linear progression of strength over the games-course. <br><br>

    I only have a few nit-picking complaints about the music balancing, and the god-forsaken flying levels. I know you have to break up the monotony of regular walking levels, but these SUCK SO MUCH. There was nothing glaring about this game that was bad, and that’s great to hear for a comeback game like this. This was Christopher’s first fighting game, and TMNT intro. I’m glad it says faithful to the material and can provide the next generation with a similar expereince that I had. <br><br>

    This game was a blast, and was easy to just chill and play after a long day. I’m super impressed with this game, and chris & I hope to see more like it. We are onto castle crashers now! <br><br>
