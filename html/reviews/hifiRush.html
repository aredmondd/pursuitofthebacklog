    <h1>Hi-Fi Rush</h1>
    <h6>A surprise that may have secured GOTY 2023</h6>
    <p>Hi-Fi Rush came out of nowhere for me. One day on my Xbox homepage, Hi-Fi Rush took up two ad spaces in the bottom left, and with its Into The Spiderverse style art, I was hooked. And then out, I found it was a rhythm game, and I closed out of the ad. Continued playing a few more runs of hades, went to sleep, and then didn’t think too much about it. After fulling completely hades a few days later, I sat at my desk depressed, once again, with Hi-Fi Rush in the bottom corner staring at me. I pressed download and started my playthrough later that day. <br><br>

    Hi-Fi Rush did something to me. It was the first time in a while that I entered a game completely blind, with no reviews, no recommendations, and I just played. No stress. I didn’t rush. I just played. They even tell you to relax in the tutorial since you need precise inputs to match the beat. Also… this was my first rhythm game. I don’t think I’ll play another one since this was a unique experience. <br><br>

    ANYWAY… I loved the game. It was a great change of pace from hades. I could just chill to some great music, mash some buttons, fall in love with great characters, and get into a good story. Everything about Hi-Fi Rush is above average, and it feels good. You can tell a great game studio made something they really love here. No outside pressures fiscally, and it shines. The art is GORGEOUS. This is one of my favorite art styles of all time, and they knocked it out of the park. Its animations are smooth and transition beautifully into cutscenes which sometimes overstay their welcome… but nonetheless, they are awesome. It’s music is phenomenal, as it not only gives you adrenaline rushes in boss fights, but it never felt repetitive or stale during long strings of combat. Its camera system for a 3-D action game is much better than the likes I played earlier this year *cough cough LSW*… Its mechanics are fantastic, and it feels good to execute a combo that entirely destroys an enemy before they can attack you. Some of this combat can feel repetitive and boring at specific points, but the game does an excellent job of adding enemies throughout the story that add challenges and give meaning to characters. Everything in this game feels essential and integral to its structure which is something very similar to that of doom eternal. This is so hard to achieve, so I commend tango game works for mastering it! <br><br>

    Another thing I loved about this game was its approach toward collectibles. They were hidden great, but possible to find. Important, but not necessary. Encouraged, but not forced. I can’t express how well this was done. This is a massive problem for me in games like LSW, where I feel pressured to complete the game because I see 467/1200 at the top of my screen every time I press pause. They truly balanced the collectibles. Currently, I haven’t 100% the game, and I don’t know if I will. I want to do another playthrough, though. It feels really good as a collector that it wasn’t necessary for my enjoyment to collect everything, which is hard to achieve. <br><br>

    The last thing I want to say about the game is that the level design and bosses are AWESOME. Every single level and boss has easter eggs, great mechanics, and always keeps you on your toes. I didn’t dislike any boss, and I sometimes felt challenged by the hard difficulty. <br><br>

    Kudos to Tango Gameworks for stepping outside of their comfort zone and making something really awesome. I had a blast in my 10-hour playthrough and can’t wait to do it again. <br><br>
    
    On a scale of Rekka to Macaron, this game gets an 808.</p>
