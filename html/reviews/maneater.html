    <h1>Maneater</h1>
    <h6>An eight-year-old’s heaven still feels good to a 20-year-old…</h6>
    <p>Maneater grabbed my attention on game pass one night while perusing for something new and exciting to play after finishing AOT season 3 and grinding vampire survivors (both my new addictions…). The download took 10 minutes, and I hopped in. I immediately fell in love with the story and was excited about what was coming. I struggled as a pup, but two things kept getting stronger throughout my 8-hour playthrough with maneater: me and my love for it. <br><br>

    This isn’t to say that maneater is a perfect game. Its camera angles and focus attacks are sloppy, the boss fights were too easy, and I wasn’t challenged throughout my time with the game. It didn’t take away from my enjoyment, but I typically like games with more challenges. <br><br>
    
    Maneater has a great gameplay loop. Evolve your shark as you fight deadly sea creatures, eat humans (this is super fun), and travel a well-designed open underwater world. For starters, the world is gorgeous. Narrow rivers, deep seas, toxic waste tunnels, it’s all there, and it’s incredible to swim around in. The “gotto” base is also gorgeous and a great addition. Also, I like how they attacked the story and how you play through the main missions. Some missions felt pointless, but I understand the need to grow my shark to face Pete, the final boss. Pete’s story is great. A gritty shark hunter who has a second chance to fight the shark that killed his father. You see Pete a few times throughout the game with an evolving story, and you end up fighting him twice, and both times are… kind of a breeze. I don’t know if it was just my cracked build (I doubt it), but these fights were nothing compared to the likes of the games I had just finished playing: Cuphead’s DLC and Hades’ final fight.  <br><br>
    
    I really liked how Maneater did collectibles. Now, this isn’t to say I sunk another 6 hours into the game because, quite frankly, I wasn’t there for the 100% trophy. I was there to kill humans as a glowing electric megalodon, and that’s what I got. But if you are into that sort of thing, it’s there. There are three types of collectibles, with the landmarks being my favorite. These each have individual stories, all narrated by Jerry from Rick and Morty. These have a ton of references, and his jokes usually land. Unfortunately, his voice can sometimes get annoying and repetitive, and I eventually just turned the sound off and turned the subtitles on. <br><br>
    
    
    The violence is excellent, but the “infamy” system is pointless. These fights were slow, easy, and took WAY too long to upgrade. I eventually got bored and never made it past level 6. This was a bummer because going in, I was excited to fight human bosses. Nonetheless, I had a blast jumping onto the sandy beaches of the ultra-rich and devouring the day drinkers who had no idea what was coming. The wanted system was decent and made me actually concerned when my health was low. <br><br>
    
    Maneater’s clearly defined steps to get to the final boss are great, and I’m glad they implemented this system, as I referred to it constantly. I love the shark builds as well. This creative freedom was not asked for but received, which ties together the game nicely. I rocked with a biotech body and everything else bone. By the time I was ¾ of the way through the game, this build was maxed, and with a bit of skill, I was shredding giant sperm whales that were double my current level. <br><br>
    
    To wrap up my messy thoughts, this game was worth my time. On a scale of apex barracuda to the apex sperm whale, this game gets an apex great white.</p>
