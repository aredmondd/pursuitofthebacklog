    <h1>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</h1>
    <h6>A VERY big Star Wars game.</h6>
    <p>Lego Star Wars is a staple game for anyone who had a childhood. Last April, this game was released under the radar for me since I live under a rock. Once I found out, I dropped $60 that night and began downloading the massive open-world lego game, and man, it didn’t disappoint. <br><br>

    LSW is an excellent addition to the franchise, and there’s no doubt about that. After a measly 114 hours sunk into the game to 100% it, I’m tired, but it was worth the grind. First of all, it looks great. Its story missions are (for the most part…) super fun and even make some of the later movies a bit more fun to experience. It’s massive, and it truly represents the scale of the Star Wars universe. I felt nostalgia throughout some early levels and made new memories exploring new areas. I felt free in this world, and I’m glad TT was able to convey this feeling accurately. <br><br>
    
    The LSW universe is massive, but there is no lack of detail. The world-building is outstanding and has side missions, collectibles, and inside jokes hidden EVERYWHERE. It’s an exceptional balance of the natural world while keeping the feel very lego. I even found myself laughing at a few of the jokes some NPCs told me. <br><br>

    Now… After almost 120 hours with this game, I noticed some fundamental flaws. First, it’s incredibly buggy in many scenarios, which is disappointing. The trend of releasing unfinished games should not catch on; unfortunately, LSW suffers from this. Its side missions, exploration challenges, and the overall game loop gets extremely repetitive and boring. The lack of good-feeling gameplay was long lost in LSW's abundant world. There are unnecessary mechanics, horrible menu design, and no real incentives to 100% the game (unless you love it as much as I do..). My final gripe with the game is that the co-op is horrendous. Trying to re-ignite the experience I had as a child with my seven-year-old brother was the first thing I thought of when buying this game, and sadly, it’s a horrific experience. Most story missions have one player do the main quest while the other roams around, waiting for the other player to finish the fun. It’s choppy, and I’m disappointed. <br><br>
    
    Overall this game is worth the purchase if you are in desperate need of some nostalgia… and are playing by yourself… and are a die-hard fan. It’s not worth $60, but I would grab it on sale if I could. <br><br>
    
    On a scale of Count Dooku to Yaddle, it’s a General Grievous in my book</p>
