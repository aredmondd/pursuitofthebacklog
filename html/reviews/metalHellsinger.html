    <h1>METAL HELLSINGER</h1>
    <h6>If Doom Eternal had a threesome with Hi-Fi Rush and Thor Ragnarok (hear me out)</h6>
    <p>A few mere minutes after Disc Room was completed, I dreaded of what game I would have to play off my backlog next. I stumbled into yakkocmn’s “5 Indie Games You NEED To Try (or else)” as I was procrastinating doing anything at all semi-productive. About 15 minutes into the video, chris said, “heavy metal rhythm game FPS with dyanmic music” and I was like… oh… yeah. I should play that right now. <br><br>
    
    Metal Hellsinger was a fantastic surprise to kick off my summer of video games. It’s fast, smooth, and I don’t know if I’ve been so focused and intune with a game in my entire life. It’s core rhythm mechanic is great, and it wasn’t hard to learn for a man who has only played one rhythm game before (though I was MUCH better at this game than Hi-Fi Rush…) It’s tutorials are fine… but some really cool stuff is hidden miles deep in the codex, and I just.. don’t care enough to go looking in the codex on most games. Jump dashes, Paz can charge, and many other semi-vital components are unfortunately lost in the depths of the codex, which is a damn shame. After the first few levels, you get in tune with the mechanics and you feel the blood pumping with the music. <br><br>

    Speaking of music , it’s great. It’s just phenomenal. I think I even like it more than Doom Eternal. OKAY WAIT RELAX I UNDERSTAND THIS ISN’T A GOOD LOOK BUT JUST GIVE ME A SECOND. Hiring real, established death metal bands to have their songs in your game is great. It benefits everyone, literally. Dev’s can have their idealized music in their game, musicians can have their music promoted in a great video game, and god damn it the fans get it to enjoy it too. Metal Hellsingers layering of drums, guitar, and vocals based on how well you are performing is genius. And holy shit when the vocals kick in, you feel like a god amongst men. Every time teh vocals kick in, it recreates that spark I felt watching the Doom Eternal intro cutscene. MH’s video and audio queues make this game immersive, and I don’t have to take my eyes off the action to see what’s going on. Some might even call it the vim of video games… I hope somebody gets that joke. <br><br>

    The game ran amazing on my xbox, and I had super high FPS and resolution while playing. I had little to no input lag, and could play the game on default settings. This is sooooo so important for rhythm games oh my goodness, thank you outsiders for what you are doing in the studio. The guns feel pretty unique, and I didn’t really get tired of them by the end of my playthrough. Dynamic BPM with tracks and individual beat syncs with the guns kept my tiny little hamster brain very happy with my short lived 6 hours with the game. <br><br>

    And now, we come to the story. Personally, I found this story quite bland. It’s impressively unegaging (more than usual) cutscenes gave me no incentive to actually pay attention. And by the time you actually finish the game, you find out that SHAWTY LITERALLY DOESN’T EVEN GET HER VOICE BACK. Okay. I think that this was a great setup to a sequel, but DAWG. You gotta at least give me some closure. And don’t even get me started on the fucking voice actors. I am so impressed on how bad these are. Paz’s gritty southern accent does not fit, and certainly doesn’t help his annoying narrator tendecies. This is made worse with the slideshow ass cutscenes where there is NO mouth movement. Listen, I know I’m complaining but cutscenes, but I am very happy that they prioritzed gameplay over story. It’s up my alley, but god damn ya’ll gotta at least make some effort. <br><br>

    I’m really happy I played this game, and will defintely be playing the sequel to see how The Outsiders have improved. <br><br>

    One last note, shoutout to the devs for the mod support on PC. This is so awesome to see from developers espicially in a climate where Nintendo exists. <br><br>
