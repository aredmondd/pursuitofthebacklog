    <h1>Update on 2023 Games</h1>
    <p>Recently, I can’t find a game I really love. After playing 2 back-to-back masterpieces, (Hades and Hollow Knight), I can’t quite find a game that doesnt stress me out, or make me frustrated, I’ve tried taking a break, and I’ve tried Celeste, Doom Nightmare, and Omori. I know these games are good, but I can’t strike the gold like I did with the last two games. <br><br>
        
    I feel like I’m in a drought, I’ve played so many greate games this year that “good” games just feel like a waste of time. I love gaming. I love game development. I love art, but it’s just not hitting the same. <br><br>

    But this is the way life goes though. I’ve fallen in love with drawing and anime again and those have bene awesome recently. I’m sure I’ll get back into it with a cool game, but for now, I think I need a break. </p>
