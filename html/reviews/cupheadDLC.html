    <h1>Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course</h1>
    <h6>A great, but sadly short extension to an already great game.</h6>
    <p>Cuphead was a much-needed re-entry into one of my favorite video games of all time. Studio MDHR comes out swinging with new abilities, music, visuals, and of course.. boss fights. All the bosses are challenging, giving me the same feel as the original game.  The new abilities were excellent, the music even better, and the story tied up the franchise well. The content was overall slim with the time they had, but Iâ€™d much rather have quality over quantity. I have no gripes with this addition and am glad I got to play through it. <br><br>

    On a scale from The Root Pack to King Dice, this DLC gets a Grim Matchstick.</p>
