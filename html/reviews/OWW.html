    <h1>Ori and The Will of The Wisps</h1>
    <h6>A phenomenal sequel that truly surpassed my expectations</h6>
    <p>So, I played Ori and The Will of The Wisps over the span of a week the day after I finished the previous game in the series. I wasn’t a huge fan of the previous game, and I was almost reluctant to play this one, but oh my god am I glad I did. <br><br>

    OWW improved on it’s signature formula in literally every area. Exploration, combat, movement, bosses, the world, the art, the music, it all just improves. It all feels WAY better than the previous game and there are a few specific shoutouts I’d like to run through along the way. <br><br>

    OWW’s world feels alive. Breathing. Like a character in the game. It’s frequent moki, hidden collectibles, and cast of side characters conitrbute ot Niwel feeling HUGE and alive. My time spent here felt meaningful, and It’s one of my favorite video games worlds ever for sure. (If only I could understand how they just be reviving mfs..) <br><br>

    OWW’s combat is cool. It’s hard to describe. It’s like a sloppy calculated. Ori can sometimes feel wierd to control and not like I’m in their control 100% of the time. The weapon selection was massive, and this was a great update, but I rarely used anything other than my standard build. I did however feel inclined to change that build up on extremely specific situations though. In certain bossfights/areas where you need to jump high or blow stuff, it felt like I had to sacrifice something. Which is GREAT. OWW’s bosses are cool too. My only complain is that, well, I never really felt challenged. I rarely died in these fights, and I beat the final boss on the first try, and trust me, I’m not that cracked. (Nightmare Grimm King took my over 75 tries…) <br><br>

    OWW’s art and music are really what propels this game into a GOAT. I played the game in 4k60fps, and holy shit it felt and looked great 99% of the time. I am so impressed that the team was able to stuff this much amazing artwork into a game that still runs well. This is the type of stuff that gets my gears moving. The music is great, and It really made some of those fights and cutscenes swell. <br><br>

    One of my gripes with the game is it’s map. It’s zoom mechanics, overcrowded UI, and slow loading times really sucked. I also kind of miss the save mechanic in the previous Ori game. I think this was the right move though. Sometimes it would feel impossible to get around something since there were no energy shards. Also, the story was better… but still not great. I just can’t really get behind the confusing lore and the random revives. Also, FUCK BAUR’S REACH. <br><br>

    The side quests and collectibles in this game are GREAT. They are hard to find, but rewarding in all the right areas. More health, energy, new abilities, currency… they exectued this perfectly. It’s ever-updating menu page is a great touch, and I feels SO good to execture a perfect string of parkour throughout Ori’s world. <br><br>

    I’m so proud of Studio Moon for turning this great franchise around. I felt like my time with Ori was well spent, and I will miss them dearly. Great job guys. <br><br>

    On a scale of Windswept wastes to Willow’s end, OWW gets a Luma Pools.</p>
