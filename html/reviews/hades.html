    <h1>Hades</h1>
    <h6>The Best Rougelike I've ever played</h6>
    <p>After I watched the true ending roll after my 87th run in Hades, I sat there dumbfounded. I had just finished a journey like no other, and I could still keep playing. Throughout my 100+ hours with the god of the dead, I smiled, laughed, and even cried. Hades blew my mind with an addicting gameplay loop, fucking gorgeous art, thrilling music, and a touching story. The rush of emotion that comes with keeping your 50-win streak alive by two health, finding the perfect duo boon, making a bond with your favorite character, or discovering an extremely cracked build is unmatched in any other game. <br><br>

    Hades’ art and music ALONE elevate it beyond its competitors by miles. Its isometric design fits it perfectly, and there are hundreds of wallpaper-able shots throughout the game. Its intentional design is well-crafted and never feels lazy. Areas like Elysium or characters like Eurydice proves this faithfully. Its animation is fluid and never feels choppy or unimmersive, even with its still character models in dialogue. Hades’ music is otherworldly. Not only are its sound effects perfectly placed, but Darren Korb’s brilliant music abilities shine through with his complete creative freedom with this project. Songs like “The Painful Way”, “In the Blood”, or “God of the Dead” show the mark of a true genius. It’s flooded with insane guitar solos and adrenaline-inducing drums. However, it can truly only be understood by listening to it. <br><br>

    Hades’ gameplay is fantastic. As an avid roguelike fan, I found myself at home with its loop and upgrade system. It perfectly balanced the random yet stronger-over-time experience you get with roguelikes. I was bad initially, but I got stronger through my time with the game. Yet, if I turned all the upgrades off, I could probably (probably…) still beat the final boss. Its difficulty scaling is super well done, and I felt completely in control of the difficulty once I unlocked the pact of punishment. Its randomness feels good within rooms and boons selections (for the most part), and I didn’t have any qualms after I unlocked the re-roll ability. I felt inspired by Skelly’s statues, even though they were worthless. Even after beating the main story content, the game turns into an interior design simulator, fishing simulator, and romance simulator. Things I didn’t know I needed. <br><br>

    Speaking of Skelly, Hades’ characters are unforgettable. Each with nuances you learn over time, and as you get to know them better, they respond differently. I fell in love with Cerberus, Eurydice, Asterius, and Charon. Zagreus is an AMAZING protagonist, and you grow alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations. The gods are faithful to the Greek Mythology it’s heavily inspired by, but don’t feel like you are reading a textbook. Instead, they feel alive and completely interactive, thanks to Hades’ dialogue system. Hades builds a pool of possible dialogue options each time you speak with someone and is randomly generated based on factors of your last run, current story progression, or whom you died to last. After over 100 hours with Hades, I felt like I had only scratched the surface of what these characters have to say since there are over 20,000 voice lines, which is about 300,000 words. Even Charon, a character who moans whenever you speak to him, has 120 voice lines. <br><br>

    Hades’ excellent story feels creative yet faithful to the source material of ancient Greek Mythology. You feel a part of the family and experience the good and bad times along with them. In your first ten wins, visiting mom feels unreal. After beating dad for the first time, you watch the sunrise, and it felt like I was seeing color for the first time. Its colors and sounds reach out past the screen and make you feel fully engaged. The sunrise is still my wallpaper to this day. I felt lost in this beautiful world I was surrounded by. <br><br>

    Hades is super rewarding to master. After you memorize boons, keepsakes, and overall gameplay flow, you become significantly better at decision-making and play. I took whichever weapon had the darkness bonus unless I was trying to beat a high heat level, where I took my favorite weapon: the bow. Hades’ weapons are phenomenal, and each offers a different playstyle that keeps you on your toes throughout your time with it. There are hundreds of different builds with each weapon, and it feels super rewarding to discover a new cracked build within the game. <br><br>

    Unfortunately, Hades’ randomness can end up biting you in the butt. Finding the correct boons can sometimes be a struggle. It’s much more rewarding to make a build wholly based on the rolls you get than someone else’s build they recommend. This is sad since I wanted to recreate many of the Haelians builds he uploads almost daily. This also takes effect within Hades’ voice line system. I spent almost 20 runs trying to get Dionysus to say one voice line to progress the story, which quickly got old. <br><br>

    Nonetheless, Hades is incredible and arguably cracks the top 3 of my favorite games. It’s worth the time, and the sequel comes out soon, so you might as well drop $20 for an experience like no other. On a scale of Tisiphone to Asterius, it gets a ughhhhhhhhhhhh.</p>
