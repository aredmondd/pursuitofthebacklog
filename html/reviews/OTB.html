    <h1>Ori and The Blind Forest</h1>
    <h6>A necessary step on the course of the Backlog</h6>
    <p>Ori and The Blind Forest was the first game I have played since Hollow Knight and Hades, two of my favorite games of all time, and it had alot to live up to. Unfortunately, it didn’t quite live up to those games, but I think that’s something I’m going to have to deal with now that I have found content that hits as hard as those games do. When it doesnt reach that 10/10 level, it just feels mid. <br><br>

    Enough about my preconcieved notions, lets down to business. <br><br>

    Ori is BEAUTIFUL. The game’s visuals are what really enrtreaged me about this game. It’s mystical vibe and encroaching light rope you in, and defintely show you what the fuck is up. The immersion is only furthered with it’s great soundtrack that had threw me through every emotion. This game is FANTASTIC at making you stressed out in the high-stakes momenets. I felt like everything was on the line all the time. <br><br>

    This game was exciting, and got me out of a really wierd creative rut where I didn’t want to explore anything unless it was a 10. Ori isn’t perfect, but it was just good enough to reel me back into playing games. This game was perfect to relax to after a hard day, and just vibe with ori. Which was something I had struggled with recently, relaxing and playing video games. This game was a necessary step back on track to loving video games, and thus, it will have a very special place in my heart. <br><br>

    The gameplay was cool. I felt motivated to seek out new abilities, and it’s exploration felt very reminiscent of hollow knight. I didn’t care too much about ability points and hearts, since I was pretty cracked with the base level stats. That being said, I still havd a 75% completion in under 6 hours. It’s wide-ranging mechanics like the super jump and glide, gave options to climb certain platforming challenges at your own discretion. This felt freeing, and I never felt too confined to tackle a challenge with required abilities. This freedom also felt daunting at times, as I had to look up how to solve a specific gravity puzzle about halfway through the game. I know I’m quite the hollow knight dickrider, but I just can’t get behind platformer’s with these sluggish control schemes like celeste and ori. I dont think I can ever go back after playing hollow knight. It’s like watching a movie in 8k with Dolby Atmos, and watching a movie in 720p on your grandma’s 1990 TV with subtitles. It’s just not the same. <br><br>

    Unfortunately, Ori’s story is lacking. It’s cliche plot points and overall questionable storyline made me uninterested in unskippable cutscenes, crowded throughout the game. I’ts random revival of the main characters’ father figure was straight up lazy, and I really have nothing else to say about that. The owl’s character development seemed rather quick and poorly executed, as she was attempting to kill me right before she killed herself, to save my life. Maybe I have been looking through these plot points in other content with rose-colored glasses, but god damn did it not work here. <br><br>

    Ori is great. I’m impressed with Moon Studios work, and will most likely be playing will of the wisps. I would reccomend it to anyone who loves beautiful games and fun platformers. Thanks Ori for bouncing me back. <br><br>

    On a scale of Windtorn Ruins to Mount Horu, Ori gets a Misty Woods.</p>
