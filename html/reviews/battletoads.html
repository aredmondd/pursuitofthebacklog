    <h1>Battletoads</h1>
    <h6>One of the Co-op games on Xbox Game Pass</h6>
    <p>Sheesh, where do I even start with battletoads. An easy reccomendation from the internet after liking castle crashers (which we did not finish because of shitty difficulty scaling and the inability to grind relentlessly) & TMNT. <br><br>
    Overall… I did not like the game. A short 3 hour playtime was good, as me & chris are looker to brighter pastures with halo: reach. Nonethless, the comedy was funny for chris, but I didn’t find many of the moment enjoyable. It was really over the top, and overengineered in alot of areas. Controls were unintuitive, the toads are extremely slow, and the combat was uninspired. The puzzles were unproportionally hard on the easiest difficulty for chris, and we ended up rage quitting alot of days. <br><br>

    Overall, bad expereince, and I’m surprised we finish it.</p>
