    <h1>Nobody Saves The World</h1>
    <h6>A very cool & unique action RPG</h6>
    <p>Nobody Saves The World was a reccomendation from Raz on YouTube on his monthly game reviews that oddly stood out to me. It’s art was unlike anything I’ve seen in years, and the gameplay mechanics sparked creativity in my tiny little gamer brain, and excited me to new extents. This game was really cool, and the TLDR is: It’s cool, but can be repetitive and have some wierd balancing issues. <br><br>

    NSTW is so so so creative, and that’s really what I’m looking for these days. Something fresh, in a barren landscape of micro transactions, AAA shooter games, EA’s yearly release, and whatever the fuck Blizzard’s is up to. It’s art is fresh, and the dyanmic music really multiplies its affects. It’s all over the place, and covers all ranges of emotion. It’s nothing crazy, but when it kicks in on those dungeon boss fights, man, it feels good. The game’s intro was SO well done. Lots of hand on examples, and not blobs of text to read over and over again (Assassins creed….) I was super excited a few hours into the game, and this propelled me to finish it in about a week. <br><br>
    
    NSTW’s world is so fucking cool. Wasted deserts, lush jungles, and whatever the fuck the calamity got going on. It’s world is ALIVE, yet it’s not overwhelming. It’s map somehow does a good job at managing this even though that it’s pretty cluttered. I’m really really happy it turned out like this since I felt inspired to check out every crevice of the world. Fast travel is great, and doesn’t feel gimmicky, and is defintely needed for the scale of this map. <br><br>
    
    Unfortuneately, the game does fall off in the latter half of your play through. Long breaks without story development kill the pacing, and can feel like a slog to sit through grinding character challenges. Before I go all out gushing about the leveling system, I want to address some flaws with this great game. It’s fights and characters aren’t balanced. Straight up. That’s it’s biggest flaw. The hardest battle in the whole game for me was in the first 6 hours. It’s final fight was a JOKE, and I was not worried in the slightest that I would die. Dungeon bosses are forgetful, and extremely repetitive without the occasional modifier (which are implemented great btw). The story is… well… alright. I think it’s okay. Its cool, and I fuck with it, but I’m not going to remember it in a few months which sucks. Also, the lack of voice actors really does not help this. The most important part of the story is a fucking slideshow and I just… well, I don’t want to read a fucking powerpoint in the middle of a game. <br><br>
        
    Last but DEFINTELY NOT LEAST the leveling system is awesome. It forces you to play with forms you may not like, and that’s really important in a game like this. The unlocking system is great, and I just overall, was super impressed with how this was executed. <br><br>

    Drinbox studios, great job! This game was great. $15 for this is a steal. 
    <br><br>
    So. I think I’m going to play persona 5. See you in 100 hours!</p>
