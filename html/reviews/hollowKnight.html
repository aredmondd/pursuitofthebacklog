    <h1>Hollow Knight</h1>
    <h6>The best world i've ever been in</h6>
    <p>Hollow Knight was a game that I have had recommended to me more times than any other piece of media ever. For that reason, I procrastinated. I can’t explain why, but I played ten games between the first time it was recommended to me and now.   The only things I knew about this game were: it’s hard and that I shouldn’t look anything up. And I did just that. <br><br>

    Hollow Knight is a BEAUTIFUL, and I mean BEAUTIFUL, game. The art is fresh, the animations are crisp, and the colors are masterfully done. The world feels sad, forgotten, and broken, clearly conveyed through its color choices. The harsh greyscale makes Dirtmouth feel like an empty wasteland of a once-bumbling city. As you go deeper into Hollownest, you discover vast sections of an empty kingdom that challenge you in new ways. These are also represented within Hollow Knight’s colors. Bright orange fungus, deep green forests, and neon pink crystal caves. <br><br>

    Aside from Hollow Knight’s beautiful aesthetics, its gameplay is phenomenal. Sensitive platforming, intense boss battles, and tons of customization make this game near-perfect. Its non-linear progression system, supported by its exploration makes you feel like you are really exploring a vast world. No gimmicks, cheats, or shortcuts: which is something only possible by not looking up locations of items within Hollownest. <br><br>

    I watched this video by TheStellarJay, one of my favorite video essayists, discussing googling video game puzzles. Throughout my time with video games, I have looked stuff up. It happens. Everyone does it. But for some reason, I felt the need to not look anything up on this playthrough with Hollow Knight, and god damn, did it make my experience great. I felt fully immersed in this brutal world with little to no help, and it was awesome. If you haven’t played hollow knight (or any game for that matter), and you want to re-spark your love for video games, oh my god, just stop looking things up. It forces you to use the game mechanics designed for those situations to overcome natural obstacles in the game. The developers did this for a reason, and my god, please listen to them. <br><br>

    After a lot of messy thoughts. This game is a banger. I’m currently like 90% done with the game and am taking a break to pursue some other stuff. Wow. This game was awesome. <br><br>

    On a scale of Dirthmouth to Ancient Basin it defintely gets a City of Tears</p>
